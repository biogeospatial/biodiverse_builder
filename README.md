# Biodiverse builder

Biodiverse is a tool for the spatial analysis of diversity using indices based on taxonomic, phylogenetic, trait and matrix-based (e.g. genetic distance) relationships, as well as related environmental and temporal variations.

This repo is for building Biodiverse using github workflows.  

It was originally only for macs but has since been extended to Windows.  

**DOWNLOAD**:  Biodiverse can be downloaded from https://shawnlaffan.github.io/biodiverse/
